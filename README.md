This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# INSTRUCTIONS:

## Main files are contained within the SRC folder.

To test the code you will first need to clone this repository to your local machine.

You will then need to have Node.js installed on your machine and navigate to the root listapp directory and install npm  
    `npm install`

Test the app with:  
    `npm start`

Run unit test:  
    `npm test`

Build:  
    `npm run build`


There are some required dependancies that you may need to install if testing the app fails:

* moment, react-moment: for formatting the timestamp to display nicely  
    `npm install --save moment react-moment`

* node-sass: for SCSS - CSS preprocessor  
    `npm install node-sass`

* react, react-dom: the basic React framework  
    `npm install --save react`

* react-currency-format: used to format the currency displayed in the list  
    `npm install react-currency-format --save`

* redux, react-redux: includes React bindings for Redux to control states  
    `npm install --save react-redux`

* redux-devtools-extension, redux-thunk: helpers for unit tests  
    `npm install --save redux-devtools-extension`


:+1: Please let me know if you have any problems testing the app or have any questions
